## Description

Call to action (CTA) buttons are probably the most essential elements on your web pages. If you want your website to drive a significant amount of parents and guardians to consider your school for their child, then this content is vital to your faculty. A CTA button makes it easy for a user to engage. This 2 column component will allow your CTAs to stand out on the page. It also provides space to include one or two buttons and text to encourage the visitor to take the next step in their search for a new school.

## Pro Tip
> Why not provide your audience with a choice of buttons? Consider different areas of the school that will persuade them to make contact: speak with admissions department, arrange a tour of the school campus, apply online now, join the school database etcâ€¦
