## Description

You can easily maximize the readability and function of header text by using the lists with icons component. This design format ensures the best use of screen space, an agreeable reading layout, and aesthetically pleasing icons that are user touch-friendly. Icons add appeal to any design and users can recognise their functionality or subject matter quickly.

## Using the Paragraph Style Component


1. Open a WPBakery Frontend Editor on the page you want to modify
2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the component menu
3. Navigate to the section Next-Gen
4. Find the "CTA component" and click the option


## Pro Tip
> Icons are truly international! Itâ€™s unlikely you will ever need a translation for an icon :)
