## Description

This subscribe form component will often be used as the first mode of contact with your school by a visitor to your website. The form is extremely simple with only a few fields and therefore will not provide the details to allow you to determine who the contact is, and why they are interested in your services. A good use for the subscribe form component is to create an invitation for users to sign up to receive a newsletter.
