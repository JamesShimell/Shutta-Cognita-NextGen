## Description

The single-column layout is a simple and effective way of using text on a page that includes a large image or video. Use the Body Text - single column with image component to include helpful and concise copy to support an illustrative image so that visitors will quickly understand the message you wish to convey.

{% include image.html img="body_text_1_col_settings.png" style="wide" lightbox="false" alt="Alt for image" caption="Body Text Single Settings" %}


## Using the Paragraph Style Component


1. Open a WPBakery Frontend Editor on the page you want to modify
2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the component menu
3. Navigate to the section Next-Gen
4. Find the "CTA component" and click the option


## Pro Tip
> The old & international adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" sums up how a single image can sometimes impart a meaning or idea more effectively than descriptive words.
