## Description

Using a grid component for body text will provide benefits to both the component user and the end reader. The grid layout improves the readability of text so that a visitor to the page can easily navigate the information they are looking for. The 2 columns layout will allow you to structure copy into relevant and orderly sections. This design format is most suitable for a tablet, desktop, or widescreen. For mobile it will display as a single column
