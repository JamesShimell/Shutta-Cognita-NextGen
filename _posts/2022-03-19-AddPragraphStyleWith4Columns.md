## Description

When 2 or 3 columns wonâ€™t do! This is the ideal component to incorporate in your design layout when you have a lot of products, services, or subjects to cover. Using illustrative images with clear and concise text in a 4 column format, you will quickly engage users and provide an easy way for them to navigate through your content.

## Using the Paragraph Style Component


1. Open a WPBakery Frontend Editor on the page you want to modify
2. Click the + symbol on the top menu to open the component menu
3. Navigate to the section Next-Gen
4. Find the "CTA component" and click the option


## Pro Tip
> Consider the type of device that will likely be used by your end-user - 4 column design layouts do not normally work well on a mobile screen.
