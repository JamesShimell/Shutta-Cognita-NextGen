## Description

The vertical timeline is a constructive graphic format to use when you have a lot of data or information to present to visitors to your website. A timeline helps to convey the chronological sequence of a series of events that you would like to impart to your audience. Timelines are beneficial as they provide a simple and organised method of recording and tracking events over a period of time, allowing readers to quickly comprehend a large amount of information. This component could be used to effectively explain the exciting development of a faculty and campus, positive improvement in examination results, or the growth of a department.
